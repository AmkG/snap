Goal: Create a virtual machine focused on two major things: list
processing and actor concurrency.

A subgoal is that within a process, anything goes: use functional
style, or imperative, or whatnot - you can mutate structures within
a process.  Communication between processes is always copying (from
the Arc-side, at least), so each process is encapsulated from one
another.

Another subgoal is to define a "symbolcode", basically a symbolic
and possibly portable (across architectures, possibly even across
different Arc implementations) form of bytecode.

Other goals: fast message passing, fast execution, generational
GC for long-lived processes, trap-exit and process linking
